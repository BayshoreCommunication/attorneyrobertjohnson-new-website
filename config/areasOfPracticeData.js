      <p>Many Uber affected individuals are unclear if they should sue the Uber driver or make a claim under Uber’s insurance coverage.

However, as previously stated, an Uber accident victim can only sue the corporation under limited circumstances. If you need a personal injury and accident attorney then you came in the right place, Rob Johnson is a professional expert in this area.</p>

    details: `
      <p>Scooters, particularly among young people and students on Florida’s campuses, have been an increasingly popular mode of transportation in recent times due to their energy, affordability, and simplicity of parking. Unfortunately, using a scooter does not offer the same level of safety as going in an enclosed automobile with a seat belt, a metal frame, and airbags. Wearing a helmet helps to protect scooter riders, but it is not compulsory by law, putting them at risk of injury or death in incidents with irresponsible drivers. If you have suffered significant injuries as a result of a scooter accident. In this situation please call the Florida scooter accident lawyers at Rob Johnson as soon as possible.</p>
